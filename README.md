## Graph Overview
A graph is a data structure that represents relationships between objects using:
- Nodes (Vertices): Represent entities in the graph.
- Edges: Represent connections/relationships between nodes.

Types of Nodes
- Root Node: The starting point of a graph with no ancestors.
- Leaf Nodes: Nodes with no outgoing edges, only incoming connections.

Graphs can be directed (one-way edges) or undirected (bi-directional edges), and they are used in various applications like networking, social media, and pathfinding.
